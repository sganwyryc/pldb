description <a href='https://github.com/jfecher/ante'>Ante</a> is a compiled systems language focusing on providing extreme extensibility through the use of a compile-time API. Using such an API, compiler extensions can be created within the program itself, allowing for the addition of a garbage collector, ownership system, type system changes, etc.
