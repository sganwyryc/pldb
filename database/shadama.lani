description Shadama is the prototype of a programming language for writing programs that create, control and visualize large numbers of objects. The Shadama environment supports liveness, yet Shadama programs are run on the GPU, which enables high performance. The primary goal of the language is to facilitate the writing of scientific simulations by students at the high school level.
