description An intermediate representation (IR) in static single assignment (SSA) form. This type of IR is favored by state-of-the-art optimizing compilers such as LLVM and GCC. Flame IR is designed from the ground up with the express intent of making it as suitable as possible for a wide range of optimizations and analyses. Flame is a collection of C# libraries for building tools that read, analyze, optimize and write managed languages.
