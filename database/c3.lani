description C3 is a systems language based on C. It intends tries to be a short step up from C rather than to replace it with a new paradigm or completely new syntax. C3 is built on top of the C2 lang project by Bas van den Berg. It goes substantially further in regards to error handling, macros, generics and strings. Although it might have some breaking changes, it can – at least currently – be considered a superset of C2.
