aka nimrod
description Nim was called Nimrod until 2014. Nimrod is a relatively new programming language that is severely underrated in comparison to other new programming languages,Â with extensive metaprogramming support, generics and exception tracking built in, optional garbage collection, and rivals C in performance. And it can compile to C, C++, Objective-C, or JavaScript. Nimrod is a statically typed, imperative programming language that tries to give the programmer ultimate power without compromises on runtime efficiency. This means it focuses on compile-time mechanisms in all their various forms.
