 summary Tea is a high level scripting language for the Java environment. It combines features of Scheme, Tcl, and Java.  Integrated support for all major programming paradigms. Functional programming language. Functions are first class objects. Scheme-like closures are intrinsic to the language. Support for object oriented programming. Modular libraries with autoloading on demand facilities. Large base of core functions and classes. String and list processing. Regular expressions. File and network I/O. Database access. XML processing. 100% Pure Java. The Tea interpreter is implemented in Java. Tea runs anywhere with a Java 1.6 JVM or higher. Java reflection features allow the use of Java libraries directly from Tea code. Intended to be easily extended in Java. For example, Tea supports relational database access through JDBC, regular expressions through GNU Regexp, and an XML parser through a SAX parser (XML4J for example).
