 summary Strongtalk is a Smalltalk environment with optional static typing support. Strongtalk can make some compile time checks, and offer "stronger" type safety guarantees; this is the source of its name. It is non-commercial, though it was originally a commercial project developed by a small start-up company called LongView Technologies (trading as Animorphic Systems).
