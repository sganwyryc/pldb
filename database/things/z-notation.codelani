description Z is not an executable notation. In general, Z specifications cannot be interpreted or compiled into a running program (or prototype or simulation). Z is not a programming language. Z texts are not just programs written in very high-level language. What would be the point of writing the program twice? Z was designed for people, not machines. For years Z was exclusively a pencil-and-paper notation.
