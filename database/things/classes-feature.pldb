type feature
description In object-oriented programming, a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). In the terms of type theory, a class is an implementation‍—concrete data structure and collection of subroutines‍—while a type is an interface.
