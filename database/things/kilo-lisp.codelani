description Kilo LISP is a small interpreter for purely symbolic LISP. Its source consists of 25K bytes of comprehensible code (20KB C, 5KB LISP) and it runs in 64K bytes of memory. None the less it offers: lexical scoping, tail call elimination, macros, quasiquotation, variable-argument functions, constant-space garbage collection, image files, keyboard interrupt handling
