 summary In programming languages and type theory, polymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types  or the use of a single symbol to represent multiple different types.The most commonly recognised major classes of polymorphism are:  Ad hoc polymorphism: defines a common interface for an arbitrary set of individually specified types. Parametric polymorphism: when one or more types are not specified by name but by abstract symbols that can represent any type. Subtyping (also called subtype polymorphism or inclusion polymorphism): when a name denotes instances of many different classes related by some common superclass.
