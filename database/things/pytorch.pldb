 summary PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library for Python, based on Torch, used for applications such as natural language processing. It is primarily developed by Facebook's artificial-intelligence research group, and Uber's "Pyro" software for probabilistic programming is built on it.PyTorch provides two high-level features: Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration Deep Neural Networks built on a tape-based autodiff system
