 summary PowerBuilder is an integrated development environment owned by SAP since the acquisition of Sybase in 2010.  On July 5, 2016, SAP and Appeon entered into an agreement whereby Appeon would be responsible for developing, selling, and supporting PowerBuilder.PowerBuilder has been in use since 1991, peaking around 1998 with around 100,000 users. While PowerBuilder's market share has declined over the years, many applications created with it are still in use today.  Over the years, PowerBuilder has been updated with new standards.  In 2010, a major upgrade of PowerBuilder was released to provide support for the Microsoft .NET Framework.  In 2014, support was added for OData, dockable windows, and 64-bit native applications.  In 2017, support was added for iOS and Android app development.PowerBuilder 2018 provides new targets to enable developers to rapidly create RESTful Web APIs and non-visual .NET assemblies, in a test-driven manner, with the native PowerBuilder IDE and C#. A preview version is currently available for select customers.
