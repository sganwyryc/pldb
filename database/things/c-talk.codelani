description C-Talk is interpreted scripting language with C-like syntax and dynamic type checking. Variables in C-Talk have no type. So there is no compile time type checking in C-Talk, all checking is performed at runtime. To preserve reference integrity, explicit memory deallocation is prohibited in C-Talk, unused objects are automatically deallocated by garbage collector.
