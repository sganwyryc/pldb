description YARA is a tool aimed at (but not limited to) helping malware researchers to identify and classify malware samples. With YARA you can create descriptions of malware families (or whatever you want to describe) based on textual or binary patterns. Each description, a.k.a rule, consists of a set of strings and a boolean expression which determine its logic.

 summary YARA is the name of a tool primarily used in malware research and detection. It provides a rule-based approach to create descriptions of malware families based on textual or binary patterns. A description is essentially a Yara rule name, where these rules consist of sets of strings and a boolean expression. The language used has traits of Perl compatible regular expressions.
