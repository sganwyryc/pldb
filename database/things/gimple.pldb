description GCC is a widely used compiler infrastructure that supports a variety of input languages, e.g., C, C++, Fortran, Java, and Ada, and over 30 different target machine architectures. GCC translates each of its front-end languages into a language-independent intermediate representation, called GIMPLE, which then gets translated to machine code for one of GCCâ€™s many target architectures. A subset of GENERIC.
