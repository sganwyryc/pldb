  -- JAL 2.3
  include 16f877_bert--define the variables
  var byte resist--define the pins
  pin_a0_direction = input--variable resistor
  pin_d7_direction = input--switch
  pin_c2_direction = output--pwm led--enable pulse width modulation
  PWM_init_frequency (true, true)
  
  forever loop--convert analog on a0 to digital
     resist = ADC_read_low_res(0)
  
     -- run measurement through flash memory
     program_eeprom_write(2000,resist)
     program_eeprom_read(2000,resist)
  
     -- run measurement through data memory
     data_eeprom_write(10,resist)
     data_eeprom_read(10,resist)
  
     -- if the switch is pressed return random value
     if pin_d7 == high then
        resist = random_byte
     end if--send resistance to PC
     serial_sw_write(resist)
     delay_100ms(1)
     -- set actual PWM duty cycle
     PWM_Set_DutyCycle (resist, resist)
  
  end loop

 summary JAL (Just Another Language) is a Pascal-like programming language and compiler that generates executable code for PIC microcontrollers.  It is a free-format language with a compiler that runs on Linux, MS-Windows and MS-DOS (OSX support). It is configurable and extendable through the use of libraries and can even be combined with PIC assembly language.
