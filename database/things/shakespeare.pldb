  [Enter Romeo and Juliet]
  Romeo:
  Speak your mind. You are as worried as the sum of yourself and the
  difference between my small smooth hamster and my nose. Speak your
  mind!
  Juliet:
  Speak YOUR mind! You are as bad as Hamlet! You are as small as the
  difference between the square of the difference between my little pony
  and your big hairy hound and the cube of your sorry little
  codpiece. Speak your mind!
  [Exit Romeo]
                     Scene II: Juliet and Ophelia's conversation.
  [Enter Ophelia]
  Juliet:
  Thou art as good as the quotient between Romeo and the sum of a small
  furry animal and a leech. Speak your mind!
  Ophelia:
  Thou art as disgusting as the quotient between Romeo and twice the
  difference between a mistletoe and an oozing infected blister! Speak
  your mind!

 related assembly-language
 summary The Shakespeare Programming Language (SPL) is an esoteric programming language designed by Jon Åslund and Karl Hasselström. Like the Chef programming language, it is designed to make programs appear to be something other than programs; in this case, Shakespearean plays. A character list in the beginning of the program declares a number of stacks, naturally with names like "Romeo" and "Juliet". These characters enter into dialogue with each other in which they manipulate each other's topmost values, push and pop each other, and do I/O. The characters can also ask each other questions which behave as conditional statements. On the whole, the programming model is very similar to assembly language but much more verbose.
