title Triton
type pl
description This is the development repository of Triton, a language and compiler for writing highly efficient custom Deep-Learning primitives. The aim of Triton is to provide an open-source environment to write fast code at higher productivity than CUDA, but also with higher flexibility than other existing DSLs.

example
 # This is a GPU kernel in Triton.
 # Different instances of this
 # function may run in parallel.
 @jit
 def add(X, Y, Z, N):
    # In Triton, each kernel instance
    # executes block operations on a
    # single thread: there is no construct
    # analogous to threadIdx
    pid = program_id(0)
    # block of indices
    idx = pid * BLOCK + arange(BLOCK)
    mask = idx < N
    # Triton uses pointer arithmetics  
    # rather than indexing operators
    x = load(X + idx, mask=mask)
    y = load(Y + idx, mask=mask)
    store(Z + idx, x + y, mask=mask)
