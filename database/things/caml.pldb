 summary Caml (originally an acronym for Categorical abstract machine language) is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language which is a dialect of the ML programming language family. Caml was developed in France at INRIA and ENS. Like many descendants of ML, Caml is statically typed, strictly evaluated, and uses automatic memory management. OCaml, as of 2017 the main implementation of Caml, adds many features to the language, including an object layer.
