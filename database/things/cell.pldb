title Cell
appeared 2017
type pl
description Cell is a very high-level embeddable language. Cell's data model combines a staple of functional programming, algebraic data types, with relations and other ideas from relational databases.

example
 type AddUser = add_user(
  id:            UserId,
  username:      String,
  signup_date:   Date,
  first_name:    String,
  last_name:     String,
  date_of_birth: Date?
 );
 
 OnlineForum.AddUser {
   id = self.id;
   // Inserting the new user id and setting all the mandatory attributes
   insert user(id),
          username(id, self.username),
          first_name(id, self.first_name),
          last_name(id, self.last_name),
          signup_date(id, self.signup_date);
   // Setting the date_of_birth attribute, if available
   insert date_of_birth(id, self.date_of_birth) if self.date_of_birth?;
 }

example
 reactive Thermostat {
   input:
     temperature: Float;
 
   output:
     on: Bool;
 
   state:
     // When the system is initialized, on is true if
     // and only if the current temperature exceeds 28°C
     on: Bool = temperature > 28.0;
 
   rules:
     // Switching on the air conditioner when
     // the temperature exceeds 28°C
     on = true when temperature > 28.0;
 
     // Switching it off when it falls below 24°C
     on = false when temperature < 24.0;
 }
