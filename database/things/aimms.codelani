description AIMMS (an acronym for "Advanced Interactive Multidimensional Modeling System") began as a software system designed for modeling and solving large-scale optimization and scheduling-type problems. AIMMS is considered to be one of the five most important algebraic modeling languages and the creator (Johannes J. Bisschop) has been awarded with INFORMS Impact Prize for his work in this language.
