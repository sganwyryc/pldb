description The Babylonian system is credited as being the first known positional numeral system, in which the value of a particular digit depends both on the digit itself and its position within the number. Only two symbols (Babylonian 1.svg to count units and Babylonian 10.svg to count tens) were used to notate the 59 non-zero digits.
