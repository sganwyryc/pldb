description SETL is a general-purpose, high-level programming language in which sets and first-order mappings are fundamental to the syntax and semantics of the language. This lends great conciseness and readability to a wide range of applications, from basic data filtering and transformation to the abstract presentation of complex algorithms. SETL is particularly good for software prototyping.

  procedure factorial(n); -- calculates the factorial n!
    return if n = 1 then 1 else n * factorial(n - 1) end if;
  end factorial;

 summary SETL (SET Language) is a very high-level programming language based on the mathematical theory of sets.  It was originally developed by (Jack) Jacob T. Schwartz at the New York University (NYU) Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences in the late 1960s.
