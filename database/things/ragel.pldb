 summary Ragel is a finite-state machine compiler and a parser generator. Initially Ragel supported output for C, C++ and Assembly source code,. Although subsequently extended to support several other languages (said to be Objective C, D, Go, Ruby, and Java) this support of other languages was withdrawn .  It supports the generation of table or control flow driven state machines from regular expressions and/or state charts and can also build lexical analysers via the longest-match method. Ragel specifically targets text parsing and input validation.

 # Scans a file for "STARTFOO[...]ENDFOO" blocks and outputs their contents.
 #
 # ENV['CHUNK_SIZE'] determines how much of the file to read in at a time, allowing you to control memory usage.

 # Uses ragel's scanner functionality even though it's not strictly necessary.
