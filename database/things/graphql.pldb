 summary GraphQL is a data query language developed internally by Facebook in 2012 before being publicly released in 2015. It provides an alternative to REST and ad-hoc webservice architectures.. It allows clients to define the structure of the data required, and exactly the same structure of the data is returned from the server. It is a strongly typed runtime which allows clients to dictate what data is needed. This avoids both the problems of over-fetching as well as under-fetching of data. Major GraphQL clients include Apollo Client and Relay. GraphQL servers are available for multiple languages, including JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, C#, Scala, Go, Elixir, Erlang, PHP, and Clojure.
