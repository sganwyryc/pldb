description Rascal solves this problem by integrating source code analysis, transformation, and generation primitives on the language level. Use it for any kind of metaprogramming task: to construct parsers for programming languages, to analyze and transform source code, or to define new DSLs with full IDE support. Rascal is a programming language; such that meta programs can be created by, understood by, and debugged by programmers.
