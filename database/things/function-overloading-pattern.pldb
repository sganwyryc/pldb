title Function Overloading
type pattern
psuedoExample add(string: str, string2: str)
description The ability to create multiple functions of the same name with different implementations. Calls to an overloaded function will run a specific implementation of that function appropriate to the context of the call, allowing one function call to perform different tasks depending on context. This is a type of polymorphism.
