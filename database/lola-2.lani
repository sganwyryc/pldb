description Lola is a notation (language) for specifying digital circuits (logic). In many ways it resembles a programming language. However, Lola texts describe static circuits rather than dynamic processes. Objects occurring in a description can be variables representing signals or registers. Their values are defined as expressions of other objects and operators representing gates.
