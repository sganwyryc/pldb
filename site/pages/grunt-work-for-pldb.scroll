* Browsing through PLDB, downloading and analyzing our data, contributing submissions. These are fun, pleasing things that should give you feelings of zen.

* But if you have too much zen and need to eat, even Disney World requires engineers to maintain a giant sewer system full of rapidly flowly human waste. If you want to help do the grunt work and keep the sewage below the park, apply for a job. All positions are hourly. No benefits. Work from anywhere whenever you want. You'll be paid entirely in <a href="https://near.org/">NEAR coin</a>. To apply, send your story to <a href="mailto:liability@pldb.com">liability@pldb.com</a>. PLDB needs grunts who move fast.
