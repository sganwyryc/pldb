* Browsing through PLDB, downloading and analyzing our data, contributing submissinos. These are fun, pleasing things that should leave you with a feeling of zen.

* But even Disney World is built on a giant sewer system full of rapidly flowly human waste. If you want to help me do the grunt work and keep the sewage below the park, apply for a job. Send your story to <a href="mailto:breck@pldb.com">breck@pldb.com</a>.
