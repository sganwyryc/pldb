* About 85% of the languages in PLDB have line comments.

endSnippet

* A language supports line comments if it defines a special token (nowadays usually `//` or `#`) where everything after that token until the end of the line becomes a comment. Example:
 wrapsOn

code
 print "Hello world" # this is a comment

* These are different from multiline comments which are delimited by a pair of tokens (such as `%{` and `}%`).

subsection The majority of languages use // or # to start a line comment

* *38%* of programming languages follow C and use `//`. C (1972) follows B (1969) which follows BCPL (1966).

* *22%* use `#`, which has become very popular thanks to languages like Python, Perl, and Ruby.

* The SQL languages all generally use `--`.

* The era of experimentation with line comment tokens appears to be over: the last time a new line comment token appeared in the top 250 was 1993.

subsection 15% of languages don't have line comments

* About 15% of the languages in PLDB don't support line comments. These include some of the key markups for the web like HTML, CSS and SVG.

* JSON famously does not support comments. But a number of its derivatives do, such as <a href="BASE_URL/languages/json-with-comments.html">JSON with Comments</a>.

* A few general purpose languages don't support line comments including Mathematica and OCaml.

subsection A few exceptions

* Like everything, there are exceptions to the common cases. A few languages, such as <a href="BASE_URL/languages/spss.html">SPSS</a>, have a more restrictive form of line comment where the line comment token has to be the first token on the line.

* A few languages also support multiple line comment tokens. The <a href="BASE_URL/languages/ini.html">Ini config format</a> supports both `;` and `#`.
