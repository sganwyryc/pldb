 ~7,099 spoken languages exist. But how many
 programming languages exist?
 link https://www.ethnologue.com/guides/how-many-languages ~7,099

paragraph
 This is one of the questions I aim to answer with PLDB.
 I am building a comprehensive database of programming
 languages.

paragraph
 Spoken languages vary widely in popularity. For example.
 English has 1.5ðŸ”—www.statista.com/statistics/266808/the-most-spoken-languages-worldwide/ billion total speakers and 375
 million native speakers. Hawaiian, an endangeredðŸ”—www.endangeredlanguages.com language, has only ~26,000ðŸ”—en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_language native speakers.

paragraph
 Similarly, some programming languages are very popular,
 others are used moderately, and many are completely
 abandoned. Javascript may be the most popular programming
 language, with approximately ~5.3ðŸ”—www.linkedin.com/topic/javascript million LinkedIn users claiming it as a skill.

paragraph
 The number of programming languages in the world depends on
 the rules you establish for deciding whether or not a language counts.

question What do other people say?

section TIOBE - 250

endSnippet

paragraph
 The TIOBE indexðŸ”—www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/ is one of the best lists of
 popular programming languages and monitors ~250ðŸ”—www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/programming-languages-definition/#instances popular
 programming languages. TIOBE tracks a
 programming language if it passes 3 tests: it must have its
 own Wikipedia page, it must be Turing complete, and a
 Google search for it must return over 5,000 search results.

section Wikipedia - 700

paragraph
 Wikipedia has a list whose goal is to include "all notable programming languages in existence", that currently lists over 700ðŸ”—en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages programming languages. Wikipedia's list excludes certain types of languages such as markup languages.

section FOLDOC - 1,000

paragraph
 FOLDOC, a 90's era online dictionary of computing, lists over 1,000ðŸ”—foldoc.org/contents/language.html programming languages, though that includes aliases.

section The Language List - 2,500

paragraph
 The Language List--started in 1991--tracks ~2,500ðŸ”—www.info.univ-angers.fr/~gh/hilapr/langlist/langlist.htm computer languages. The Language List includes popular languages as well as many "published languages". If a language was published in a journal it may be on the list, regardless of its implementation history or popularity.

section HOPL - 8,945

paragraph
 HOPL is a collection curated by Diarmuid Pigott. It lists 8,945ðŸ”—hopl.info programming languages!

section J.E. Sammet - ~165 (In 1971)

paragraph
 Jean SammetðŸ”—en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_E._Sammet was an early computer pioneer, helping developer the COBOL language. She also was one of the first to start tracking programming languages and as early as 1971 tracked ~165ðŸ”—pdfs.semanticscholar.org/48af/15cfd104f7a5d91fef8f3136fe88502ada95.pdf languages.

question What do I say?

paragraph
 At the moment I am closely tracking hundredsðŸ”—./languages.html of
 programming languages with thousands more in my
 periphery. Until I have a more comprehensive database
 across all the languages I track, I'll have to make some
 estimates.

paragraph
 My current estimate for <b>active general purpose programming languages is between 500 and 2,000</b>.

paragraph
 My current estimate for <b>all active computer languages is between 5,000 and 25,000</b>.

paragraph
 As my database improves I will refine my definitions and estimates accordingly.

section Reproducibility notes

paragraph
 A hard count of programming
 languages was made by querying the PLDB database, which
 consists of thousands of human-checked facts about
 programming languages. Confidence intervals were added ad
 hoc through spot checking with the reference lists
 above.
