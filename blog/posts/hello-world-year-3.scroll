 I started PLDB 2 year ago today! Since that time:

list
 - In the past year, PLDB has gone from less than 1,400 languages to over 3,800! Almost a 3x increase!
 - In the past year, I added the programming language features pageðŸ”—./lists/features.html which now lists 90 features!
 - I also added the file extensions pageðŸ”—./lists/extensions.html which lists over 1,300 file extensions!
 - The programming language design conference pageðŸ”—./lists/calendar.html has 6 conferences listed for 2020.

 Unfortunately the number of articles on PLDB is 14 
 (counting this one). Just like last year, limited time and
 resources has meant building up the dataset took priority.
 Hopefully the next year will see a lot of growth in number
 of posts!
